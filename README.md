# Credit Risk Analysis

## Purpose

In this project, we were tasked with utilizing supervised machine learning tools to compare whether or not users will be a credit risk in the future. We accomplished laying the groundwork for further machine learning operations on the data. We trained and tested our data utilizing a number of different machine learning models. By using RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier we set up models that are prepared to take in more data that will help our client better recognize risk from potential lendees.

## Results

The following are the outputs that show the efficacy of different machine learning models utilized on the data

### - RandomOverSampler

### - SMOTE

### - ClusterCentroids

### - SMOTEENN

###  - BalancedRandomForestClassifier

  - Feature Importance from RandomForestClassifier

### - EasyEnsembleClassifier
